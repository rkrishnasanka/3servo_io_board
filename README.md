# 3servo_io_board
A gereral purpose 3 servo + 1 Buff, 2 normal IO board. Made for use with the arduino and a small laser turret in 
order to connect multile servos and control using an on/off transistor switch and some directly connected I/Os.

Still does not solve the rat's nest problem completely. In retrospect a shiel would have been better :P
